		<div class=".ann-santos-advice">
			<h2>Take your time and don't overwhelm yourself. ;-)</h2>
			<ul>
			<li>Be patient with yourself. Don't feel like you have to learn the whole computer world at once.</li>
			<li>Be comfortable with this lesson before moving on to the next one.</li>
			<li>Speaking from personal experience:  when you're learning new coding languages...ONE AT A TIME!!!!</li>
			<li>Trying to learn Python, HTML/CSS, and Java at the same time is like trying to learn Spanish, Italian and Portuguese all at once.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Play with it every chance you get.</h2>
			<ul>
			<li>Treat the command line and the bash as a "new toy" & make it your favorite toy.</li>
			<li>See what you can do with it. </li>
			<li>Show off what you can do with it. </li>
			<li>Teach someone else what can be done with it...hey, wait a sec...</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Teach it to someone else!</h2>
			<ul>
			<li>Prove to youself and boost your confidence by sharing your new knowledge.</li> 
			<li>It makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside!</li>
			</ul>
			<h3> That's about it for now. Enough procrastinating for both of us. Back to work!!  ;-D</h3>
